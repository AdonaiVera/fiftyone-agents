```

## How to Use

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Dataset**

```python
import fiftyone as fo

# Load your dataset
dataset = fo.Dataset("my_vlm_dataset")
```

### **Step 2: Launch FiftyOne and Open the Panel**

```python
session = fo.launch_app(dataset)
session.wait()
```

### **Step 3: Use the VLM Testing Panel**

1. **Open the Panel**: Look for "Multimodality VLM Testing" in your panels
2. **Select Ground Truth Field**: Choose the field containing your ground truth data
3. **Choose Prompt Template**: Select from predefined templates or create custom prompts
4. **Customize Prompt**: Use `{field_name}` syntax to inject dynamic content
5. **Select Model**: Choose one VLM model to test
6. **Run Analysis**: Click "Run VLM Analysis" to execute the model
7. **Check Results**: Use FiftyOne's evaluation panel to analyze performance

## Practical Use Cases

### **Model Comparison**
- Compare different VLMs on the same dataset
- Evaluate which models perform best for specific tasks
- Balance inference speed against accuracy for production use

### **Prompt Engineering**
- Experiment with different prompt structures
- Use dynamic field substitution for contextual prompts
- Test how prompt variations affect model performance

### **Dataset Analysis**
- Identify challenging samples across different models
- Find samples where models disagree or fail
- Test models on filtered views of your data

## Pro Tips

### **Dynamic Prompts**
- Use `{field_name}` to create contextual prompts
- Start with predefined templates and customize as needed
- Include ground truth data in prompts for better evaluation

### **Model Selection**
- **FastVLM**: Best for speed-critical applications and low-memory systems
- **Qwen2.5-VL**: Excellent balance of performance and efficiency
- **GPT-4V**: Highest accuracy for complex reasoning tasks (no local memory usage)

### **Memory Management**
- Start with smaller models if you have limited RAM
- Use filtered views to test on smaller subsets first
- Monitor memory usage during model execution
- Consider using OpenAI GPT-4V for memory-constrained environments

### **Evaluation**
- Use FiftyOne's evaluation panel for comprehensive analysis
- Test multiple models on the same samples
- Focus on samples where models disagree

## Future Enhancements

- **Batch Model Testing**: Test multiple models simultaneously
- **Custom Model Integration**: Support for additional VLM architectures
- **Advanced Metrics**: More sophisticated evaluation metrics
- **Export Capabilities**: Save results for external analysis
